## PyTorch ML Concepts: From Theory to Tensor 🧠

### *A Practical, Well-Documented Collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models Implemented Purely in PyTorch*

-----

### ✨ Overview & Project Mission

> This repository is a dedicated learning resource and practical code reference for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It focuses exclusively on providing **end-to-end, custom implementations using PyTorch**.
>
> **Our Mission:** To bridge the gap between theoretical ML knowledge and practical PyTorch implementation by breaking down complex concepts into clean, executable, and reproducible Jupyter Notebooks.

### 🚀 Key Features & Value Proposition

  * **100% PyTorch Focused:** Every model is implemented using native PyTorch components, avoiding high-level wrappers where clarity is key.
  * **Concept-First Documentation:** Each notebook begins with a clear theoretical explanation of the algorithm, loss functions, and optimization techniques.
  * **Comprehensive Scope:** Covers algorithms from foundational supervised learning (Logistic Regression) up through modern deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs/Transformers).
  * **Clear & Clean Code:** Emphasizes readability, proper commenting, and adherence to PyTorch best practices.
  * **Ready-to-Run:** Minimal setup required; designed to be cloned and executed immediately for rapid experimentation.
